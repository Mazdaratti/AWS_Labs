# Amazon VPC Peering - Intra-Region Configuration Lab

## Lab Overview

This lab guides you through creating an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) peering connection between two VPCs in the same AWS region. You'll configure network routing and test connectivity between EC2 instances across the peered VPCs.

**Amazon VPC Peering** is a networking connection between two VPCs that enables routing traffic between them using private IPv4 addresses. Instances in either VPC can communicate as if they were in the same network.

### Topics Covered

- Create a second Amazon VPC (VPC-2)
- Create public subnets in both VPCs
- Configure internet gateways
- Set up route tables with internet routes
- Configure security groups to allow traffic across VPC peering
- Launch test instances in both VPCs
- Create intra-region VPC peering connection
- Configure routing across the peering connection
- Test network connectivity between instances
- Clean up all resources

## ðŸš€ How to Deploy

1. Ensure you have deployed the VPC-1 infrastructure from the previous lab first.

2. Initialize Terraform:

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```
3. Review the execution plan:

   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```
4. Apply the configuration:

   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```
5. After completion, Terraform will output the private and public IPs of both instances.
6. Test connectivity:

   * SSH to the VPC-1 instance using its public IP
   * From the VPC-1 instance, ping the private IP of the VPC-2 instance
   * SSH to the VPC-2 instance using its public IP
   * From the VPC-2 instance, ping the private IP of the VPC-1 instance

## Clean Up Resources

To avoid ongoing charges, destroy all created resources when done:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

## Key Concepts

* **VPC Peering Requirements**:

  * VPCs must have non-overlapping CIDR blocks
  * Peering connections are not transitive
  * Routes must be added in both VPCs' route tables
  * Security groups must allow the desired traffic

* **Reserved IP Addresses**:

  * The first 4 and last IP in each subnet are reserved by AWS
  * Example: In `192.168.0.0/28` (`192.168.0.0`â€“`192.168.0.15`):

    * `192.168.0.0`: Network address
    * `192.168.0.1`: VPC router
    * `192.168.0.2`: DNS server
    * `192.168.0.3`: Reserved
    * `192.168.0.15`: Broadcast address (unused)
